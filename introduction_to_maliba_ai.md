## I. The MALIBA-AI Initiative

MALIBA-AI is a community-driven AI initiative. The name comes from "Mali Ba" (Great Mali) and AI (Artificial Intelligence), pronounced as Mali-Ba-AI. Our goal is simple yet powerful: use artificial intelligence to solve local problems while ensuring no Malian is left behind.

Over the last half-century, the field of AI has exploded—from expert systems and neural networks at institutions like MIT and Stanford, to the rise of machine learning and natural language processing, and now to cutting-edge companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind.

Nothing in recent history has impacted our daily lives at this scale. AI integration is transforming the world. While computing infrastructure is essential, we focus on the AI model itself as the most transformative component—though that’s a debate for another post.

With that assumption, AI's power has been impactful in the developed world—everything has been enhanced by artificial intelligence, well, almost everything. AI-powered automation has transformed industries in some way. Manufacturing, finance, healthcare, transportation, and education are now deeply influenced by AI. But in many developing countries, including Mali, these advancements have not been equally rewarding.

This is especially true for sectors such as healthcare, agriculture, finance, and education. Overall, the entire country's AI infrastructures are underdeveloped or non-existent. Despite the reach of AI-powered platforms like Meta and Google, their impact remains surface-level. A 2018 report from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) showed that only 12.7% of Malians used the internet, with just 3.2% of households owning a computer [1]. These figures are for a country with a population of around 23.77 million in 2023, according to the world bank [2]. These are sobering numbers—and most of these internet users primarily access social media. We can roughly estimate that while they command a significant portion of web traffic, social media platforms constitute a tiny fraction of total websites—likely well below 0.5%. Thus, social media-only users typically miss out on most internet resources.

Yet beneath the digital divide lies an even deeper barrier: language. Most Malians speak indigenous languages like Bambara, Fulfulde, and Songhay—not French or English, the languages that dominate AI systems and interfaces. Since these languages are primarily oral, the requirement for text input becomes a major obstacle.

This linguistic divide creates real inequality. Consider education: children learn more effectively in their mother tongue, yet top educational technologies require knowledge of colonial languages. In healthcare, diagnostic AI tools can't help if patients and providers can’t interact in their language. In agriculture, farmers can’t use AI-driven platforms they don’t understand.

The transformative potential of AI—the democratization of specialized knowledge, the automation of routine tasks, the realization of human potential—remains inaccessible to most Malians.

But this exclusion isn’t inevitable. In fact, AI itself offers the solution. With advances in natural language processing and speech recognition, we can build systems that speak and understand Malian languages. We can create speech-first interfaces that don’t require literacy or formal education. We can build a future where AI includes everyone.

The spark that lit MALIBA-AI came from this observation: "It’s a plus to know how to code, but it won’t be a requirement anymore." With AI, even people with no programming background can build apps or digital tools by talking to a machine. But this only works if the AI speaks your language.

MALIBA-AI aims to challenge this exclusion. Imagine a farmer in Sikasso building a website by talking to an AI in Bambara. A mother in Timbuktu getting medical advice in Songhay. Students learning science through AI-powered platforms in their native tongue.

This is possible today. Our mission is to build speech-first AI systems for Malian languages so that technology becomes accessible to all. International companies may overlook us—but we can build it ourselves.

**Impact Areas:**

- **Education**: AI tutors in local languages could offer personalized support to every child.
- **Agriculture**: Voice interfaces could deliver crop advice, weather alerts, and market data in Bambara.
- **Healthcare**: Patients could explain symptoms and receive help in their native language.
- **Business**: Entrepreneurs could use AI tools to manage businesses without needing to learn French or English.

By removing the language barrier, we remove the most fundamental obstacle to Mali's participation in the AI revolution.

## II. Philosophy

MALIBA-AI follows a community-driven, open-source model. It’s not-for-profit and focused entirely on Mali’s specific challenges, especially its linguistic diversity. We work on one problem at a time, developing models and tools to tackle real-world issues.

We see this as collaborative community research, not traditional open research. It’s driven by engineers, linguists, researchers, and students—people passionate about using AI for good in Mali or maybe just passionate about our Mali-Ba.

## III. Objective & Plans

Our goal is to document and test each idea: will it work for Mali? If so, how can we build and deploy it effectively? Projects go through trial and error, backed by community-driven experiments.

We don’t expect overnight success. For now, the plan is to grow the community, introduce the concept, and begin work on practical solutions from our project stack.

## IV. Field of Interest

MALIBA-AI currently focuses on one core area: **speech systems for Malian languages**. Our aim is to build technologies that make it possible for people to interact with AI using voice in their native language—without needing to read or write.

We believe that this approach will be the key to making technology accessible to Malians of all educational backgrounds.

## V. Who is MALIBA-AI for

MALIBA-AI is for everyone who believes in inclusive technology. Our community includes AI practitioners, developers, educators, linguists, artists, and everyday citizens. Whether you help build models, test tools, raise awareness, or preserve languages—there’s a role for you.

## VI. Publications

MALIBA-AI will publish the following:

- **Blog Posts**: For updates and community highlights.
- **Whitepapers**: These are in-depth project specs—like research proposals—that cover goals, hypotheses, and methodologies.
- **Research Papers**: For peer-reviewed or formal documentation of experiments and findings.
- **Model Documentation**: Open guides for usage, training, and contributions to our AI models.

*Note: We are not academic scholars—we're an enthusiast community tackling real problems that we think we can  do something about.*

## VII. Copyright & License

All projects will be open-source. We avoid proprietary dependencies wherever possible, and everything will be hosted with permissive licenses. Our goal is wide accessibility, reusability, and community ownership.

## VIII. Conclusion

MALIBA-AI was founded to fix one major issue: the exclusion of most Malians from AI due to language. With speech-first systems, we can empower a farmer to build a site in Bambara, or a student to study in Songhay. The social and economic impact could be transformative.

Global tech giants might never prioritize Mali—but we can. Our mission is bold, but even small steps can open big doors. By making AI truly inclusive, we ensure no Malian is left behind.
